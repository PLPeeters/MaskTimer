# Mask Timer

Mask Timer is an Android app that helps you keep track of how long you have worn your masks and when it's time to change them, be it when:

* wearing the same mask continuously
* swapping between surgical and FFP2/KN95 masks
* wearing a mask occasionally, such as an FFP2/KN95 mask for when you go shopping

The app helps you make sure you change your mask after 4 hours of total wear, which is the maximum recommended time. No more guesstimating when it's been 4 hours.

Simply add your masks, then tap the one you're wearing to track its use. After it has been worn for 4 hours total, Mask Timer will issue a notification to let you know it's time to change it. Once it's changed, tell the app and the timer will reset. It's that simple.
